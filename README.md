# Transcript Recorder App

This is a Flutter mobile app I built as part of an assignment. The app lets you:

Record audio** from the microphone
Play it back** before uploading
Upload audio** to a backend server
Get real-time transcription** (using AssemblyAI API)

---

## Features Covered

 Worked on multiple test cases:

   Recorded short and long audio clips
   Verified playback before upload
   Successfully uploaded audio to backend
   Received transcriptions from the API
   Added extra checks, like error handling for failed uploads or missing permissions.

---

## What I Could Do

 Fully working audio recording → playback → upload → transcription flow
 Integrated with AssemblyAI for accurate text transcriptions
 Clean UI with basic buttons and status updates

---

##  What I Couldn’t Do (yet)

  Didn’t add offline storage of transcriptions
  No UI polish or advanced design (kept it simple to focus on functionality)
